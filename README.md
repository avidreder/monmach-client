# Monster Machine Client

Monster machine is a tool that leverages the Spotify Web API to help you quickly find recommended songs. It is designed for you to create a "genre" of music, seed it with artists or songs, and Monster Machine will generate a track list for you.

Feel free to use it at https://monmach.com, though it is under active development, so beware, there be bugs.
